2. Then, you will be directed to **nil.ai**'s main dashboard. Here, there are several features that you can use, such as join new class, add new class, and go into one of the classes available. Beside that, you can filter the classes to search better if you act as both student and teacher in different classes. Lastly, you can also navigate to profile page or log out of the account.

   Here is how it looks like if you want to join a new class. You will need to enter a unique class code in order to join the class.

3. Navigating to profile page, you can see and edit your name, take a look at classes you joined, for both studied and taught. In this page, you in-app coin will also be shown.

**Teacher's Features**

1. If you teach a class, once you enter the class, you will be shown with this display where there are sidebars to navigate between a class' features, and the main content. It includes the detail of the class which you can edit it and even copy class code to invite students. Besides that, you can also make a new section for the class and new assignment.

2. If you want to create a new assignment for your students, you will be directed to this page, where you can customize your assignment! Here, you can name your assignment, which section it belongs to, decide deadline, and an optional description of it. Below, you can also add question to your own liking and requirement. You can adjust the points each question holds to, add image, and enter the rubric to give points based on your student's answer. This point will then be the reference of how our system, **nil.ai** will grade your student's answers.

3. After you create a new assignment, your students will then be notified about a new assignment coming up. Do not worry, because you can always edit your assignment again in case it is needed. If you want to grade your students, you can go to the assignment and see this page. At the bottom part, **nil.ai** will show you the assignment's submission status and you can choose whether to use **nil.ai**'s automated grading system OR you can also check manually if you want.

   If you choose to go with **nil.ai**'s auto grading system, then you'll just need to put it to rest while **nil.ai** will score each of the submitted answer. While waiting, you can go explore our pages, makes new assignment, and do important things.

4. Although **nil.ai** auto grading check is always available, you can always check manually. This is where you can review our grading system, check manually, give some comments, and of course publish it so that your students can see their score on the assignment.

For now, the journey ends here, BUT **nil.ai**'s team will continue to develop some new and interesting features to support educators and students out there through **nil.ai**!
